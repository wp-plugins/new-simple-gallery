Want to display images as an automatic slideshow that can also be explicitly played or paused by the user? New Simple Gallery rotates and displays an image by fading it into view over, with navigation controls that pop up when the mouse rolls over the Gallery.

* 	Show images either as an automatic or manual slideshow.
* 	All slide consists of an image that can be hyperlinked.
* 	All slide can have a description associated with it.
