Want to display images as an automatic slideshow that can also be explicitly played or paused by the user? New Simple Gallery rotates and displays an image by fading it into view over, with navigation controls that pop up when the mouse rolls over the Gallery.

* Show images either as an automatic or manual slideshow.
* All slide consists of an image that can be hyperlinked.
* All slide can have a description associated with it.

**This is the XML based slide show, so to add or delete the images.**	
		
1. Take the "new-simple-gallery.xml" XML file from plugin folder.		
2. add/update/delete the image in the xml file.		
3. You can use full image path in XML file.	

**We can use this plug-in in different way.**		

1. Go to widget menu and drag and drop the "New Simple Gallery" widget to your sidebar location.
		 	
2. Copy and past the below mentioned code to your desired template location.	
&lt;?php if (function_exists (nsg_show)) nsg_show(); ?&gt;			

3. Use the below code to the page or post.			
<code>[new-simple-gallery=filename=new-simple-gallery.xml&width=400&height=300]</code>
	
filename = new-simple-gallery.xml		
This is the name of the XML file gallery, this xml file should be available in plugin forder.		
width = 400			
This is width of the gallery.			
height = 300			
This is the height of the gallery.
